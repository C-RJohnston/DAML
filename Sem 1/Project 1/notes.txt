build a model designed off the microboone model, fairly accurate but also very slow. Will need to use a faster model to perform a hyperparameter
search.
Halved the number of layers and then doubled each filters
muons and electrons are often confused for one another which makes sense because muons and electrons are both leptons and therefore
similar patterns
photons are often predicted for pions and protons as these decays produce photons and photon pair production can produce
Pions are rarely incorrectly predicted as pions have a distinguishing kink that the others don't and the model can easily train on that.

Doing a combination of hyperparameter training and manual tuning using a similar model to the microboone model
